# Speed-Dating-Machine-Learning
Speed Dating Success Prediction – Machine Learning Coursework Project

This repository contains a full end-to-end data science project using the Speed Dating dataset to explore what factors influence whether two participants decide to match.

The project focuses on data preparation, exploratory analysis and the application of multiple machine learning models to predict dating outcomes and participant preferences.

Project overview
The work includes:
- Data cleaning and feature selection from a real-world behavioural dataset
- Exploratory data analysis to understand demographic and preference patterns
- Supervised learning for both classification and regression tasks
- Model evaluation and comparison using appropriate performance metrics
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

Models implemented
- Logistic Regression (match / no-match classification)
- Linear Regression (preference and score prediction)
- Artificial Neural Network (MLPRegressor)
- Grid Search for hyperparameter optimisation
- k-fold cross-validation
- Learning curve analysis
- Confusion matrix and performance visualisation

Tools & technologies
- Python
- pandas & NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
